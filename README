afternoon's Vim Config
======================

- Uses Vundle
- Is designed for MacVim (though other Vims should mostly work)
- Disables the arrow keys!
- Maps lots of stuff with <leader>
- Has been evolving for a while and is probably crufty
- Does a fairly shit job of setting up autocomplete (buffer only, nothing clever)

Usage
-----

- Clone to .vim or vimfiles
- Clone Vundle into bundle/vundle (or submodule? YMMV)
- :BundleInstall to install/update bundles
