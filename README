afternoon's Vim Config
======================

- Uses Vundle
- Is designed for MacVim (though other Vims should mostly work)
- Disables the arrow keys!
- Maps lots of stuff with <leader>
- Has been evolving for a while and is probably crufty
- Doesn't have great autocomplete (buffer only, nothing clever)

See top of vimrc for the bundle list.

Install
-------

- git clone git@github.com:afternoon/dotvim ~/.vim (or vimfiles)
- mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
- git clone git@github.com:gmarik/vundle ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
- :BundleInstall
